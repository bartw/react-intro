# react-intro

## Mission statement

This repo will give an intro to React and its concepts.

I'm going to start by explaining what React is and by giving a brief description about how it works.

Then I will set up a basic development environment from scratch and quickly explain the tools used.

After this I'll use small code examples to demonstrate the different concepts in React.
